To download this small app you can either download the whole project from the github
or you can just download the WinFormsCalculator.exe file.

This app was built for either the use of the user's mouse, or the numpad. Keyboards lacking a numpad
are not fully supported in this application. You will be able to input numbers and use the enter key
but you wont be able to select operations from the keyboard. 

NOTE:
This is my first attempt at creating an application outside of the CML and using a GUI.
